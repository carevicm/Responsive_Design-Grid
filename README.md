README for Mondrian Project

Introduction

Hello and welcome to my Mondrian Project! 
I've always been fascinated by the works of Piet Mondrian, an artist known for his modernist, abstract compositions involving primary colors, black lines, and white spaces. 

Drawing inspiration from his art, I've decided to create a digital representation using CSS Grid.


Features

CSS Grid: I've leveraged the power of CSS Grid to create a Mondrian-style layout. It's a beautiful testament to the flexibility and capabilities of the grid system.

Responsive: Though the artwork is fixed in size for maximum authenticity, the overall layout is centered on the screen, making it viewable across devices.

Customizable: If you're feeling creative, you can easily adjust the colors or sizes of the individual blocks by tinkering with the CSS.


How to Use

Customization

Feel free to play around! Modify the CSS under the <style> tag if you want to adjust the layout or colors. You can also add or remove grid items in the HTML content to create your own unique Mondrian-inspired masterpiece.
